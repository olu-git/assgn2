                <p id="c-align">
                    Housing prices have been <span class="blue_text">soaring globally</span>, especially over the past
                    decade. While
                    certain demographics benefit from this, the majority face the daunting ramifications of a
                    <span class="blue_text">heated property market</span>. <br><br>
                    Below is exploration of how housing prices have changed in recent times.
                    Specifically, the <span class="blue_text">global and Australian housing market</span> will be
                    briefly inspected before more
                    detailed insight is provided on <span class="blue_text">Melbourne's market</span>.<br><br>
                    Various measures are used such as the <span class="blue_text">House
                        Price Index (HPI)</span> of a few indices, <span class="blue_text">average pricing</span> and
                    <span class="blue_text">median pricing</span>. These measures
                    allow for
                    meaningful comparison between nations, states, and even suburbs.

                        The <span class="blue_text">CBD area seems to be the most expensive</span>. This is likely due
                        to its centrality and proximity
                        to jobs and important locations. In addition, Melbourne's heritage and general city aspect add

                        In the boxplot above, the council area of Boroondara was noted because it served as three
                        outliers in the Southern Metropolitan. Thereby, <span class="blue_text">Boroondara</span> was
                        selected as the <span class="blue_text">area of choice</span>
                        for this bubble plot where we look at the <span class="blue_text">relationship between price and
                            landsize</span> - adding
                        <span class="blue_text">property type and rooms</span> as extra dimensions. <br><br>
                        As <span class="blue_text">landsize increases, so do property prices</span> - exemplifying the
                        moderately positive relationship
                        between the two variables.
                        In addition, <span class="blue_text">room numbers rise with house pricing</span> which furthers
                        the relationship shown between
                        the two variables shown in the heatmap.
                        As the minimum price rises, units begin to vanish and then townhouses. This reflects the fact
                        that the two aforementioned property types are far cheaper than houses. Budget buyers may need
                        to consider <span class="blue_text">less rooms</span> and having <span class="blue_text">units
                            or townhouses</span> as their home of choice. <br><br>
                        It is worth noting, that <span class="blue_text">one unit in Camberwell</span> is far more
                        expensive than other units, honing

                    <p>
                        The line chart here highlights how house prices over the past 10 years have changed across the
                        <span class="blue_text">top five costliest suburbs</span> in Melbourne. <br><br>
                        <span class="blue_text">Brighton and Canterbury</span> have consistently shared the title of the
                        <span class="blue_text">most expensive suburb</span> in the
                        past decade until property values <span class="blue_text">surged</span> in the past year for
                        <span class="blue_text">Middle Park</span>. <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, the bar chart displays the average price of each suburb for the selected period of
                        time. <br><br>
                        Here, we reaffirm that <span class="blue_text">Brighton and Canterbury</span> indeed have the
                        highest property valuation of the
                        period - <span class="blue_text">valued at over $2 million</span>. <br><br>
                        The ability to select specific years and find the average house price allows for better overall
                        <span class="blue_text">comparison of Suburb affordability</span>. On the other hand, wealthy
                        individuals can determine the
                        <span class="blue_text">most prestige suburbs</span> to live in.

            To conclude, property prices tend to be higher as we approach the CBD. More specifically, the
            <span class="blue_text">Southern
                Metropolitan</span> area has the most expensive properties, the <span
                class="blue_text">Boroondora</span> council area contain affluent suburbs,
            and
            <span class="blue_text">Canterbury</span> is the costliest suburbs with house prices averaging over <span
                class="blue_text">$2.3
                million</span>. Home buyers should
            consider
            several aspects before purchasing their homes such as <span class="blue_text">landsize, garage space</span>
            and especially the number of
            <span class="blue_text">rooms</span>
            in their house. Alternatively, <span class="blue_text">developing regions</span> like the <span
                class="blue_text">Western
                Metropolitan</span> could be ideal for both new
            families and investors.
